# 📜 README: *script myself*

> **Disclaimer:** This project’s design and documentation (including this README) are partially AI-assisted, with all outputs reviewed and supervised by human maintainers.

## 1. Introduction

**script myself** is an open-source project designed to help individuals struggling with **procrastination** and **ADHD** overcome the barrier of *starting actions*.
The project provides a **minimal executable syntax** to abstract daily routines into **decision scripts**, reducing unnecessary cognitive load and decision fatigue.

Example:

```txt
wake_up -> brush_teeth -> make_coffee -> open_laptop
```

This approach transforms vague intentions into **actionable chains**, lowering the cost of initiation and fostering consistent behavior.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Technical Inspiration

* Shell scripting: automating repetitive commands with minimal syntax.
* Rule engines: abstracting decision logic into human-readable formats.
* Behavioral scripting: using lightweight “life scripts” as cognitive prostheses.

### 2.2 Psychological Foundations

The design of *script myself* is grounded in behavioral psychology and cognitive science:

* **Decision Fatigue**: Each decision depletes willpower \[1].
* **Executive Dysfunction**: ADHD often impairs initiation and task switching \[2].
* **Habit Loop**: Cue → Routine → Reward \[3].
* **Behavioral Activation**: Actions can precede motivation \[4].
* **Tiny Habits**: Breaking goals into micro-steps enhances sustainability \[5].

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 行为先行，身份随之 (Act As If → Become)

* **Origin**: Self-Perception Theory, Embodied Cognition.
* **Mechanism**: Performing behaviors aligned with a desired identity helps internalize it \[6].
* **Example**: Stand like a confident speaker before a presentation.
* **Caution**: Requires real actions, not empty pretense.

---

### 3.2 立即行动 (Act Immediately)

* **Origin**: Behavioral Activation, Behavioral Momentum.
* **Mechanism**: Initiating small actions prevents overthinking \[4].
* **Example**: Write for 5 minutes instead of “planning to write later”.

---

### 3.3 未完成驱动力 (Harnessing the Zeigarnik Effect)

* **Origin**: Zeigarnik Effect (1927).
* **Mechanism**: Unfinished tasks create cognitive tension, motivating continuation \[7].
* **Example**: Start a report by writing only the title → tension pushes you to continue.
* **Caution**: Too many open tasks can cause anxiety.

---

### 3.4 分块与小胜利 (Chunking & Micro-Wins)

* **Origin**: Goal-Setting Theory, Cognitive Load Theory.
* **Mechanism**: Splitting goals reduces difficulty and provides confidence boosts \[8], \[9].
* **Example**: “Read 2 pages today” instead of “Finish the book”.

---

### 3.5 降低行动门槛 (Lower Barriers to Action)

* **Origin**: Principle of Least Effort, Nudge Theory.
* **Mechanism**: Environmental design reduces resistance \[10].
* **Example**: Put workout shoes next to your bed.

---

### 3.6 循序渐进学习 (Scaffolded Learning)

* **Origin**: Scaffolding (Bruner), Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky).
* **Mechanism**: Learn with supports matched to cognitive stage \[11].
* **Example**: Use illustrated books before reading dense theory.
* **Note**: Positioned as an extended principle, not core.

## 4. Example Usage

```txt
[morning_routine]
wake_up -> brush_teeth -> drink_water -> open_laptop
```

```txt
[study_session]
open_notebook -> write_date -> read_summary -> start_exercise(5min)
```

---

## 5. Roadmap

* [ ] Define minimal DSL syntax (sequential, branching, parallel).
* [ ] Implement interpreter (Python prototype).
* [ ] Add interactive CLI for script execution.
* [ ] Integrate reminders & habit-tracking.
* [ ] User testing with ADHD/procrastination groups.

## 6. AI Usage Statement 🤖

This project leverages **AI systems (e.g., large language models)** to support development and user adoption.
AI involvement is **assistive, not determinative**, and all contributions are subject to human review.

### Roles of AI in *script myself*:

1. **Script Generation**

   * AI can assist users in drafting initial decision scripts based on natural language prompts (e.g., “Morning routine for a student with ADHD”).
   * Output is treated as a *starting template*, not a final prescription.

2. **Personalization**

   * AI can adapt routines to individual user contexts (study, work, ADHD-related challenges).
   * Personalization respects user input and goals.

3. **Learning & Knowledge Support**

   * AI may explain behavioral principles (e.g., Zeigarnik effect, habit loop) in accessible ways.
   * Provides scaffolded learning materials, analogies, and simplified examples.

4. **Documentation, Design & Review**

   * AI is used to co-draft and refine project documentation (including README), assist in design decisions, and provide iterative feedback.
   * Human maintainers supervise AI output to ensure accuracy, inclusivity, and ethical alignment.

### Limitations & Responsibility

* AI outputs are **not medical or clinical advice**.
* Users are encouraged to **critically evaluate and adapt** AI-generated scripts to their real-life context.
* Final responsibility for content and actions rests with the user and maintainers, not the AI.
